# Multi-Sheet Plot

This is a simple LISP file to help plot multiple sheets based on their location in the drawing.

To use it type PTT and select the plot regions followed by the plot sheet. This requires that you draw the plot regions and also make a plot sheet as an object.
It automatically changes the number on the sheet and names the plot based on that number.
